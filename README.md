# Worldwide lottery / Raffle Number Generator

### Please gamble aware and when the fun stops, STOP!

### I will not be held responsible for any monies lost.

##### Built-in libraries used as part of your Python installation.

I made this so that you could contribute to it and make this a worldwide lottery / raffle number generator.
Please fork this, add to it but keep the original code and then make a pull request so it can grow covering world wide lotteries.
I have not clicked on generate tickets yet, you'll have to try it yourself :smiley:
